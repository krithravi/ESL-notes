\chapter{Introduction}

Hello, wonderful souls! \\

This is a quick set of notes to supplement
the ESL classes at El Buen Samaritano.
I'm teaching an introductory course during the
Spring 2021 session.
I'll be updating this as the semester progresses.
Hopefully this helps! \\

This document probably has loads of typos,
so please don't hesitate to let me know if I've
messed something up, or if you want me to
cover a certain topic.\\

Sincerely,\\
Krithika
